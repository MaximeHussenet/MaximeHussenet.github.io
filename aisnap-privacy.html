    <h1>AI Snap - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: February 8, 2026</em></p>

    <p>AI Snap ("the App") is developed by Maxime Hussenet. This privacy policy explains how the App handles your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>All user data is stored locally on your device and is never uploaded to our servers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Photos you take or select are saved locally in the app's Documents directory. They are not uploaded to our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>API Keys:</strong> If you provide your own API keys, they are stored in the iOS Keychain (encrypted) and are never transmitted to us.</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis Results:</strong> AI analysis results are stored locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Credits and Purchases:</strong> Purchase records are managed by Apple's StoreKit and stored locally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party AI Services</h2>
    <p>When you analyze a photo, the image is sent to the AI provider you select. The App supports:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> (GPT models) &mdash; <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><strong>Anthropic</strong> (Claude models) &mdash; <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><strong>Google</strong> (Gemini models) &mdash; <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Images are sent directly to these providers for analysis. Their respective privacy policies govern how they handle that data.</p>

    <h2>Analytics</h2>
    <p>The App uses <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> to collect anonymous usage data such as app opens, feature usage, and device type. This data does not identify you personally and is used solely to improve the App. See <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase Privacy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads. AdMob may collect device identifiers and ad interaction data to serve relevant ads. You can opt out of personalized ads in your device's privacy settings. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">Google Ads Privacy</a>.</p>
    <p>You may purchase the "Remove Ads" option to disable all advertising.</p>

    <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
        <li>No location data</li>
        <li>No contacts or calendar data</li>
        <li>No user accounts or login credentials</li>
        <li>Photos are never stored on our servers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
